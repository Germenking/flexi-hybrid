## Purpose of Flexi-hybrid repository

The purpose of creating Flexi-hybrid project is to develop the 
Adaptive Detached Eddy Simulation model on the DGSEM framework

## Information on the original Flexi solver

FLEXI is a high-order numerical framework for solving PDEs,
with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics.
FLEXI is based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element
Method (DGSEM), which allows for high-order of accuracy 
and fully unstructured hexahedral meshes.
The solver is parallelized very efficiently and scales up
to hundreds of thousand cores.

FLEXI has been developed by the [Numerics Research Group (NRG)][nrg]
lead by Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz at the Institute of Aerodynamics
and Gasdynamics at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This is a scientific project. If you use FLEXI for publications or
presentations in science, please support the project by citing
our publications given in [references](REFERENCE.md).

## Installation / Documentation

For installation instruction see [install](INSTALL.md).

See the full documentation including usage instructions and
tutorial for FLEXI [here][flexi].
